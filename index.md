# Tutorial: 

This project, **Red Planet Staffing**, is a *backend microservice* for a Martian staffing marketplace. It helps connect **workplaces** needing temporary staff with **workers** looking for shifts. The system allows for creating and managing these *entities (workers, workplaces, shifts)*, handling *shift claims*, and *cancellations*. It's built using **NestJS** for the overall structure, **Prisma** for database interactions, and **Zod** for ensuring data is correct. It also includes a **pagination system** for handling large lists of data efficiently. A sample *API client script* demonstrates how to retrieve data, such as finding the **top-performing workplaces**.
